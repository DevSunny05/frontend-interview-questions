1.what is load balancing in aws
  Load Balancing in AWS distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances, containers, or IP addresses to ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability
 for applications.


	ALB for HTTP/HTTPS apps.

	NLB for high-performance TCP/UDP workloads.

	Classic only for legacy systems (avoid for new setups).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.what is auto scaling in aws
  Auto Scaling in AWS is a service that automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in your application to maintain performance while optimizing costs.
	Key Features:

	Dynamic Scaling: Adds/removes instances based on demand

	Health Checks: Replaces unhealthy instances

	Multiple Policy Types:Target Tracking (maintain metrics like CPU at 60%)

	  Step Scaling (add/remove instances in steps)

	  Scheduled Scaling (predictable traffic patterns)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.what are the diff types of load balancer in aws  
	AWS offers three main types of load balancers, each designed for specific use cases and operating at different layers of the OSI model:
	
  1. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
		Layer: 7 (Application Layer - HTTP/HTTPS)
		Best For: Web applications, microservices, and container-based architectures.

Key Features:
✅ Path-Based Routing – Directs traffic based on URL paths (e.g., /api → backend servers).
✅ Host-Based Routing – Routes traffic by domain name (e.g., app.example.com vs. api.example.com).
✅ Supports HTTP/2, WebSockets, and gRPC – Modern protocol support.
✅ Server Name Indication (SNI) – Hosts multiple TLS-secured domains.
✅ Integration with AWS WAF – Protects against web attacks.

Use Cases:

Modern web apps (React, Angular, etc.).

Microservices (EKS, ECS, Lambda).

A/B testing (weighted routing).

  2. Network Load Balancer (NLB)
Layer: 4 (Transport Layer - TCP/UDP)
Best For: High-performance, low-latency applications.

Key Features:
⚡ Ultra-High Performance – Handles millions of requests/sec.
🔌 Static IP & Elastic IP Support – Predictable IP addresses.
📡 Preserves Source IP – Useful for firewalls and auditing.
⚙ Supports TLS Termination – Offloads SSL decryption.

Use Cases:

Gaming servers (UDP traffic).

IoT applications.

VPNs and financial trading systems.

  3. Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)
Layer: 3 (Network Layer - IP packets)
Best For: Third-party virtual appliances (firewalls, intrusion detection).

Key Features:
🛡️ Transparent Traffic Inspection – Routes traffic to security appliances (e.g., Check Point, Fortinet).
🔗 GENEVE Protocol Support – Encapsulates traffic for virtual appliances.
🌐 Scales with Traffic – Automatically adjusts to load.

Use Cases:

Next-gen firewalls (Palo Alto, Cisco).

Deep packet inspection.

Compliance monitoring.

  Distributes traffic across EC2 instances, containers, or IPs.ALB (L7), NLB (L4)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.whats the diff between active and passive health checks
   1. Active Health Checks (Proactive Monitoring)
Definition
Active health checks involve the load balancer periodically sending test requests to backend instances to verify their health status.

How It Works
The load balancer sends probes (HTTP/HTTPS/TCP requests) at configured intervals.

Instances must respond within a timeout period (e.g., 200 OK for HTTP).

If an instance fails multiple consecutive checks, it's marked unhealthy.
  
  2. Passive Health Checks (Reactive Monitoring)
Definition
Passive health checks analyze real user traffic to detect failures, without sending separate probes.

How It Works
Monitors actual requests/responses:

HTTP 5xx errors

TCP connection failures

Timeouts

If an instance shows consistent failures, it's marked unhealthy
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.what happen if your load balancer fail how to manage this condition

   Always deploy LBs across multiple AZs

   Implement cross-region failover for critical applications

   Monitor both LB health and backend instances

   Automate failover procedures

   Test failure scenarios regularly (Chaos Engineering)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.what is diff bet geo load server balancing and global server load balancing

   Geo Load Balancing
	What? Routes traffic based on user geographic location.

	Use Case: Localized content, compliance (e.g., GDPR).
	
	How? Uses DNS (e.g., AWS Route 53 Geoproximity Routing).

	Limitation: Slower failover (DNS-dependent).

  Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB)
	What? Smart traffic distribution worldwide based on health, latency, and policies.

	Use Case: Mission-critical apps needing low latency and instant failover.

	How? Uses anycast IPs (e.g., AWS Global Accelerator).

	Advantage: Faster failover, supports all protocols (TCP/UDP/HTTP
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.what are the key scaling options available in aws auto scaling


1.Dynamic Scaling

	Target Tracking: Maintains metrics (e.g., 60% CPU).

	Step Scaling: Adds/removes instances in steps.

	Simple Scaling: Basic fixed adjustments (legacy).

2.Scheduled Scaling

	Scales at fixed times (e.g., business hours).

3.Predictive Scaling

	Uses ML to forecast demand and scale proactively.

4.Manual Scaling

	Manually adjust capacity (for testing/overrides).

5.Health-Based Scaling

	Automatically replaces unhealthy instances.

6.Mixed Instances

	Combines On-Demand + Spot Instances for cost savings.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.how does the application load balancer differ from network load balancer

  Application Load Balancer (ALB)

Operates at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)

Best for: Web apps, APIs, microservices

Key Features:
✅ Path/host-based routing
✅ Supports HTTP/2, WebSockets
✅ Integrated with WAF
❌ No static IP (DNS only)

Network Load Balancer (NLB)

Operates at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)

Best for: High-performance, low-latency apps

Key Features:
✅ Static IP/Elastic IP support
✅ Handles millions of requests/sec
✅ Preserves source IP
❌ No HTTP awareness

When to Choose:

Use ALB for web applications needing advanced HTTP routing

Use NLB for gaming, IoT, or when static IPs are required
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11.how can you achieve cross zone load balancing with elastic load balancer
   Application Load Balancer (ALB)

✅ Always enabled (cannot be disabled)

No configuration needed

Network Load Balancer (NLB)

❌ Disabled by default
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12.what is the purpose of target group in alb
  What is a Target Group?
A logical grouping of backend resources (EC2, Lambda, IPs) that receive traffic from an Application Load Balancer (ALB).

Key Purposes
Backend Routing

Directs traffic to specific resources (e.g., /api → EC2, /images → Lambda).

Health Monitoring

Regularly checks instance health (e.g., HTTP GET /health).

Automatically removes unhealthy targets.

Traffic Management

Enables sticky sessions (session affinity).

Supports multiple protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, gRPC, WebSocket).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13.how can you ensure that your alb automatically scale base on traffic demand
  1. Set Up Auto Scaling with ALB
Prerequisites
An ALB with a target group (registered with EC2 instances).

A launch template (defines EC2 instance configuration).
	min-size: Minimum instances (e.g., 2 for high availability).

	max-size: Maximum instances (e.g., 10 to limit costs).

	target-group-arns: Links ASG to ALB’s target group.
 B. Configure Scaling Policies
Use target tracking to scale based on demand:
Adjust TargetValue (e.g., 60 = scale when CPU hits 60%).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14.what is the purpose of a listeners in elastic load balancer
  A listener in AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ALB, NLB, or CLB) defines how traffic is routed to backend targets.
 It acts as a traffic director by checking for connection requests from clients and forwarding them based on configured rules.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15.what is the purpose of a listeners in elastic load balancer
  A Target Group is a logical grouping of backend resources (like EC2 instances, Lambda functions, or IP addresses) that receive traffic from an ALB.
 It acts as the final destination for requests routed by the ALB’s rules.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16.explain the concept of sticky sessions in elb
  Sticky sessions ensure that requests from the same user are consistently routed to the same backend instance during a session.
 This is critical for stateful applications where user data is stored locally (e.g., shopping carts, user logins).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17.how do you configure health checks for targets in an elastic load balancer

  1. Purpose
Health checks ensure your load balancer:
✅ Routes traffic only to healthy targets
✅ Automatically replaces unhealthy instances
✅ Maintains application availability

2. Key Configuration
Protocol: HTTP (recommended), HTTPS, or TCP

Path: /health (customizable endpoint)

Interval: 30 seconds (default)

Thresholds:

2-3 successes → Healthy

2-3 failures → Unhealthy
------------------------------------------------------------------------

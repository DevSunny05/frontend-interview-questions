Access Control

Signed URLs/Cookies for private content.

Origin Access Control (OAC) to block direct S3 access.

Geo-Restriction to allow/block countries.

DDoS & Threat Protection

AWS Shield Standard (free) and Advanced (paid).

AWS WAF integration to block SQLi, XSS, bots, and OWASP Top 10 threats.

Monitoring & Compliance

CloudFront Access Logs (request tracking).

AWS CloudTrail (audit API changes).

Real-time metrics via CloudWatch.

Advanced Security

Lambda@Edge for dynamic authentication.

Security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options) for anti-XSS/clickjacking.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.what is the significance of adistribution in cloudfront
 A distribution is the core configuration unit in AWS CloudFront that defines how content is delivered to end users.
 It acts as the gateway between your origin servers (where content is stored) and the global network of CloudFront edge locations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.can CloudFront be use for both static and dynamic content

Yes! AWS CloudFront is designed to accelerate both static and dynamic content by leveraging caching, edge computing, and optimized routing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.what is ttl in CloudFront and how does it impact caching

 TTL (Time to Live) defines how long CloudFront caches content at its edge locations before checking the origin for updates.
 It controls cache freshness and directly impacts performance, cost, and content consistency.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.how does cloudfront integrate with aws waf
  AWS CloudFront integrates seamlessly with AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) to protect web applications from common threats like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), DDoS attacks, and malicious bots.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.what is the benifits of sign url or signed cookies in cloudfront
WS CloudFront’s Signed URLs and Signed Cookies provide secure, time-limited access to private or restricted content. 
They are essential for controlling who can access your content and for how long. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11.can cloudfront be use it with other aws services and if so how
AWS CloudFront seamlessly integrates with multiple AWS services to enhance performance, security, and scalability for web applications, APIs, and media delivery.

🔹 Key Integrations & Benefits
S3 → Global static content caching (websites, media).

EC2/ALB/NLB → Accelerates dynamic apps & APIs.

Lambda@Edge → Runs serverless functions at the edge (auth, redirects, A/B testing).

API Gateway → Caches API responses, reduces backend load.

AWS WAF/Shield → Blocks DDoS, SQLi, XSS attacks.

MediaPackage/MediaStore → Low-latency video streaming (HLS/DASH).

RDS/DynamoDB → Caches database-driven content.

Global Accelerator → Optimizes network routing for ultra-low latency.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12.what is regional cache server and how it is diff fron edge location cache server

1. Edge Location Cache
What It Is
Ultra-fast, micro-caches deployed in 300+ locations worldwide (e.g., Tokyo, London, NYC).

Closest to end users for minimum latency (millisecond response times).

Key Features
✔ Lowest Latency: Serves cached content from the nearest edge.
✔ Static & Dynamic Content: Can cache both (dynamic content with short TTLs).
✔ High Churn: Frequently purges less-popular content to free up space.



2. Regional Cache (Regional Edge Cache)
What It Is
Larger, persistent caches in 13+ AWS Regions (e.g., us-east-1, eu-west-1).

Acts as a mid-tier cache between edge locations and the origin.

Key Features
✔ Higher Capacity: Stores more content than edge locations.
✔ Longer Retention: Keeps objects cached longer, even if unused at edge locations.
✔ Reduces Origin Load: If an edge location misses a cache, it checks the regional cache first.


How They Work Together
User Request:

First checks the nearest edge location.

If not found (cache miss), checks the regional cache.

If still not found, fetches from the origin server (e.g., S3, EC2).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13.what is geo locaton in aws

Geo Location in AWS refers to identifying and restricting access to content based on a user's geographic location (country/region).
 It’s commonly used for compliance, licensing, or security purposes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 However, it integrates seamlessly with AWS and third-party DRM solutions to secure premium content.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16.how to diasable cache for cludfront

Method 1: Use the "CachingDisabled" Managed Policy (Recommended)
This is the easiest way to disable caching for a CloudFront distribution.

Steps:
Go to AWS CloudFront Console → Distributions.

Select your distribution → Behaviors tab.

Edit or create a Cache Behavior.

Under Cache Policy, select:

CachingDisabled (Predefined AWS policy).

Save changes.

✅ Effect:

CloudFront forwards every request to the origin (no caching).

Best for APIs, dynamic content, or real-time data.

Method 2: Custom Cache Policy (TTL = 0)
If you need more control, create a custom cache policy with Min TTL = 0.

Steps:
Go to CloudFront Console → Policies → Cache Policies.

Click Create Cache Policy.

Set:

Minimum TTL = 0 (disables caching).

Default TTL = 0.

Maximum TTL = 0.

Attach this policy to your Cache Behavior.

✅ Effect:

Similar to CachingDisabled but allows customization.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17.what are cludfront invalidations

AWS CloudFront invalidations allow you to forcibly remove cached content from CloudFront's edge locations before it expires naturally.
 This ensures users receive the latest version of your files immediately.

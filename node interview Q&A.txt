1.What is nodejs??

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers
to run JavaScript code on the server side. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine.


Key features and characteristics of Node.js include:
1.JavaScript Runtime:
2.Event-Driven and Asynchronous
3.Single-Threaded:
4.NPM (Node Package Manager):
5.Wide Range of Modules:
6.HTTP Server Capabilities:
7.Cross-Platform:
8.Scalability:

2.how nodejs work or Explain the event-driven architecture of Node.js.

Nodejs base on V8 engine.It is virtual machine that utilizes js as scripting lang and achive high output via non blocking i/o and single threaded event loop
It uses an event loop to handle asynchronous operations, allowing it to efficiently manage multiple connections.

3.Where can we use nodejs??
Web Servers 
Web Servers
Real-Time Applications
Microservices Architecture
Command-Line Tools
Single-Page Applications
Content Management Systems
Streaming Applications
IoT (Internet of Things)
Desktop Application
Backend for Mobile Applications

4.what are nodules in nodejs??
Modules are like Javascript liabraries that can be use in Node.js application to include a set of function.
To include module in nodejs applicatin use require() func with parantehis containing name of module.
Nodejs has many module to provide functionality some of them are http,utils,fs,url,querystring,stream,zlib

5.Why nodejs prefer over other backend technology???

Nodejs is really fast
NPM has over 50000 bundles for at the developers disposal
perfect for data intensive,real time web applicatin as nodejs never wait for an API to return data
Better syncranization of code between server and client due to same code base.
East for developers to start using nodejs in their project as its JS library.
